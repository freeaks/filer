about:   
---   
an attempt at writing a file manager in pyqt, for linux or osx,   
with heavy influences from the Amiga Workbench and Directory Opus 5

file manager: [filer.py](https://raw.github.com/freeaks/filer/master/test-tree/screenshots/filer.png) <-- click for screenshot   
preference program: [prefs.py](https://raw.github.com/freeaks/filer/master/test-tree/screenshots/prefs.png)   
asl requester program: [requester.py](https://raw.github.com/freeaks/filer/master/test-tree/screenshots/asl_req.png)   


status:   
---   
alpha.   
it's working, but far from being feature complete,   
and there's almost no error checking yet.   


done:   
---
- file requester: browse filesystem, open directory or execute file   
- file manager: display files, reordering, dragndrop, copy, execute   
- preferences: choose pattern, font color   
- global menu: open requester, preferences, quit   


todo:   
---   
preferences:   
- adding and removing new icons (for filetypes)   
- activate the 'operation mode' selection (classic / dopus5 behavior)   


file manager:   
- adding more file operations (copy, deleting, moving, renaming etc)   
- implement some more menu items   
- create a dopus5 like file lister   
- create icon info window
